# Improper Integral Analysis with Sympy

This Python script uses the Sympy library to analyze improper integrals. It can help you determine whether an improper integral is convergent or divergent by computing the limit of the integral as a variable approaches a certain value. This README will guide you through using the script and understanding its results.

## Installation

Before using this script, make sure you have Python and the Sympy library installed. You can install Sympy using pip:

```bash
pip install sympy
```

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Define your function `f(x)` in the script. Make sure it is a valid Sympy expression.

2. Specify the integration limits `a` and `b` within the script.

3. Run the script.

4. The script will analyze the improper integral and provide results in LaTeX format.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script:

```python
# Define the function for the integral
f = 1 / (x - 4)

# Define the limits of integration
a, b = 4, 8

# Run the script to analyze the integral
# (code provided in the script file)
```

## Understanding the Results

The script will generate LaTeX output that explains whether the improper integral is convergent or divergent. It also provides detailed calculations and limits as follows:

- The function `f(x)` you defined.

- Whether the function is bounded or not in the specified interval.

- The integral expression in LaTeX format.

- The limit of the integral as a variable (`epsilon`) approaches 0 from the right.

Based on the limit's finiteness, it will indicate whether the integral is convergent or divergent.
